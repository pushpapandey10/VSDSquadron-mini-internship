# TASK 5 :-

# Bluetooth Automated Smart Access Using VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board 

# Project Overview :

"Bluetooth Automated Smart Access" system is the perfect integration of modern technology, convenience, and security. It employs the power and possibility of a servo motor, a Bluetooth module, and a VSD Squadron Mini board to redefine human interaction with space and the solution of everyday issues.
From controlling water taps to controlling lighting and appliances, to smart door and security applications, Bluetooth automated smart access can be used for a variety of purposes, such as increasing productivity and streamlining daily operations in a variety of settings.
This project is a novel way of monitoring and regulating door access with the help of a servo motor, Bluetooth module, push button, and onboard LED. The main feature of the system is its responsiveness to Bluetooth orders, which initiate an accurate open-close process. The VSD Squadron Mini engages the servo motor in response to a signal received by the Bluetooth module, which causes the door to move. Using this technology, the system will allow a smooth, hands-free experience, enhancing convenience and security in streamlined and streamlined access control.


# Components Required for the project :

1.) VSD Squadron Mini RISC-V board

2.) Jumper Wire 

3.) Servo Motors (SG90)

4.) Micro USB Cable

5.) Bluetooth HC-05 Module

THe VSD Squadron Mini RISC-V board is powered by CH32V003F4U6 chip with 32-bit RISC-V core based on RV32EC instruction set, optimized for high-performance computing with support for 2-level interrupt nesting and supports 24MHz system main frequency in the product function. Bluetooth HC-05 Module (Pins PD6, PD7, PC7, GND, 3.3V) enables wireless communication between the system and the user’s smartphone for remote control and the Bluetooth module’s State pin indicates connection status. Servo Motor (Pin PC6) acts as the locking mechanism, which is controlled by the microcontroller. The Onboard LED displays the system status, indicating the locked or unlocked states. The jumper wires are used to connect the different parts of a circuit. These wires help in easily linking the VSD Squadron Mini RISC-V board, Bluetooth HC-05 Module and the Servo Motor.

# Circuit Connection for Bluetooth Automated Smart Access :

The VSD Squadron Mini RISC-V board, powered by a CH32V003F4U6 chip, comes with a 32-bit RISC-V core based on the RV32EC instruction set. The system is high-performance computing-based and supports 2-level interrupt nesting. Its system main frequency runs at 24MHz. Communication between the system and the user's smartphone to provide remote control is through the Bluetooth HC-05 Module (Pins PD6, PD7, PC7, GND, 3.3V). The Status pin of the Bluetooth module represents its state. A servo motor acts as the lock (Pin PC6) of the system. The system is represented by onboard LED as well as whether the system is in the locked state or unlocked. The jumper wires are used for interconnecting various components of the circuit. This set of wires facilitates easy and efficient connection between VSD Squadron Mini RISC-V board and Bluetooth.
